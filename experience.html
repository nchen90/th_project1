        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I have had a wide variety of different jobs in the past in search of my true passion in life. I have worked in retail customer service, restaurants, computer technician, and even a mushroom farm.</p>
        <p>Growing up I have always been interesting in technology. I would always be the guy that people asked for help with their technical issues. It lead my down the path of working with computer hardware. After years of working in IT, I stumbled into the world of software. The idea of creating nearly anything you can think of has made me find my new passion, CODE.</p>
